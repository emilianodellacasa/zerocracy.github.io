Every day we meet many CTOs, architects, developers and startup founders,
who like the management model of [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com),
which is based on [microtasking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GozQCUH2D0I).
They understand that paying by result is a much more effective way
of managing human resources, comparing to old and traditional
monthly salaries. However, they are not ready to jump into it immediately.
Indeed, it's risky. You may lose your entire team, together with the
source code it maintains.

You may want to watch this video, which I recorded just recently:
[Five steps to migrate from traditional management to microtasking](https://youtu.be/0mOn9MvuMzU).
It suggests what exactly a software team has to do in order
to be more prepared for microtasking.

We, in Zerocracy, can help you prepare your team. We are offering
a consulting package for you, to help you streamline the transition
from an old-fashioned full-time office slavery to a much more
flexible and cost-effective model of microtasking and freelancing.

Each month we will be spending one day with your team, analyzing their
working process and creating a list of recommendations for improvements.
Our CEO, [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com), will lead the process, and a few our
best programmers will help him analyze the code your guys are working with.
We will do it all remotely.

Then, your developers will implement these improvements and we will come back
in a month with the next round of the audit.
There are eight months in the standard package, but you
may have fewer or more, depending on the performance of your team
and their desire to learn and improve.

The cost of one full-day consulting session is $2,400.

Order now, we are not fully booked yet!
