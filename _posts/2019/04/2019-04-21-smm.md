Zerocracy is a software platform that unites programmers and project
sponsors, increasing the quality of project management through
its unique and revolutionary [principles of work](/policy.html) and
software tools, including
[Zerocrat](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html),
the AI-powered chatbot.

The biggest challege for Zerocracy is to break the _status quo_ and
convince everybody, including engineers and project sponsors,
that programmers, testers, architects, and designers must be paid for the results they
deliver, not [for the time](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html)
they spend. In order to accomplish this
ambitious goal Zerocracy builds a community of like-minded individuals
who are ready to share the same vision.

Social media is one of the most important channels of communication with the
community---its existing and potential members. Here is a set of rules
and principles we adhere to in the area of social media marketing.

We are present in these social networks (only them):

  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zerocracy/)
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0crat)
  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zerocracy/)
  * [Instagram](https://instagram.com/zerocracy/)

We announce the following information there:

  * Recent news about our activities
  * Statistical information about our business (metrics)
  * Third-parties' publications, which we find relevant

We publish exactly twice per day, including weekends.

There are also two Telegram chats, which we support:
[@zerocracy](https://t.me/zerocracy) and
[@zold_io](https://t.me/zold_io).
