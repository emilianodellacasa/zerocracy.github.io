  As a fresh graduate, I struggled to find a path in
  my career. Did Zerocracy help me? How much did it help?

I graduated in 2017 and managed to find a full-time job as
an Android Developer. For most people, that would be it,
"I'm on the right track." Not for me!
I saw that there was something wrong in this market:
working in a multi-national company wasn't a proof that I was
good enough.

I started to read blog posts every day and finally,
I found out about Zerocracy and everything started to make sense.

In the beginning, I had to read a lot of blog posts, and the
[Policy](https://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html),
and to watch [some videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxZAzmY_OPw40I1-YStWqhw/).
Since I was new to the industry I didn't struggle a lot,
because I wasn't used to the "old concepts" in most cases.

I didn't manage to fit in the [sandbox](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#33) projects easily,
I discussed this with my mentor [@ypshenychka](https://github.com/ypshenychka)
and she hinted me to contact the ARC of the project, which I wanted
to join, even if it wasn't a sandbox project.

This way I joined some projects, had a lot of time to implement
things that were new for me, and got paid enough for what I produced.

As you know, some tasks may take a long time to be closed, you discuss the issue,
you implement a solution, your solution being reviewed, you
resolve reviewer's comments, wait for the ARC to merge
and wait for the quality review to be done.
In such a complex pipeline you may screw it up and mess
your tasks, I had a system to go along with all of this. Let me explain it
how it works for me:

Fist, I decide that I will work for the next one hour (for example),
pick the oldest task in my agenda, ask a question or check
if something I was waiting for is done, check if I still have time,
if yes I go to the next task.

I have a mentor in Zerocracy (who is a very helpful and kind person),
and I'm mentoring someone currently (who didn't ask me about anything
and I guess he never needed me). Having a mentor isn't a good idea,
having an examiner is enough for me.

The role REV is a really complex role for me, you must not trust
what the developer has submitted and prove that you are right
and he did miss something important.
Previously, I asked the ARC of the projects I'd like to revoke
the role REV from me because I want to deal with less pressure
in my tasks till I participate in a project that I'm
experienced enough with its tools.

Sometimes you care more about money, then you have to accept
tasks that will take you less time and effort to close them
and have room in your agenda for more.
If the task will take you a lot of time and you don't care
about the experience you will get by working on it, refuse
it and leave a room for more tasks that you can make
easier money by finishing them.

Zerocracy is a freelancing platform, you can work in as many
projects as you want, you can leave the project or refuse the
task if you want. Working as a freelancer means you own your
time and you don't have to accept any task that you don't want.
Of course, there is a risk that you won't be able to pay the
rent next month because things aren't going well and
you didn't make enough money. Freedom worth it, but you have
to plan things first.

During planning the move from full-time to freelancing, I'm combining
both right now. It's not easy to make that while you still need time
to learn new things or work on your own projects. Basically, I do
the minimum required effort to keep my full-time job
boss satisfied, don't tell him that I'm willing to do more
unless I'm not satisfied with the quality of my work.

Since I knew about Zerocracy, my learning curve boosted and know
I can gain more experience and deal with the more professional market.
That's why I really suggest you start working in Zerocracy, only if
you care about your freedom and want to be a freelancer.
