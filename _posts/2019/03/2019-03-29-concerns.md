I decided to publish this blog post in order to summarize the most
popular concerns potential clients of Zerocracy express, when they
start thinking about moving from a traditional management to microtasking.
The blog post will be get new content regularly, and will be used
as a reference tutorial for our sales front.

Q: Who will do a very expensive and time-consuming work of breaking
larger tasks to [microtasks](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html)?

A: We don't have a dedicated role for that.
Programmers decompose larger tasks into smaller pieces
by themselves, using our own
[patent-pending](http://www.google.com/patents/US20120023476) methodology,
known as [Puzzle Driven Development](https://www.yegor256.com/2010/03/04/pdd.html),
explained in
[M28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmSaC_OjIbQ).

Q: It seems that your management model relies on the architect a lot. What
happens if he/she makes serious mistakes? Will the project have fatal
consequences?

A: Indeed, the
[architect](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html) is a
[technical dictator](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/21/convince-me.html)
in Zerocracy.
However, his/her decisions are
[always](https://www.yegor256.com/2019/01/15/what-if-architect-is-wrong.html)
documented and the documentation passes
[regular reviews](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html),
as [M2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYq05UAwzNk)
explains.

Q: It seems that in order to hire
[Zerocrat](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html) to manage my projects I have
to change my programmers, because my current team is used to work
in a traditional [pay-by-hour](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html)
model. Is it true?

A: Yes, most likely the majority of your programmers won't be able to adopt
and you will have to let them go, if you quickly jump into the pay-by-result
and [microtasking](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html).
And Zerocracy won't work, unless you pay everybody
by result only, as [M3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_Bhg4vW58) explains.
However, you may save some of your best developers,
if you transition slowly, as [M62](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOn9MvuMzU) suggests.

Q: How Zerocrat knows who has to work with a particular microtask? It seems
that this decision can only be made a human, not AI.

A: Zerocrat has its own [multi-factor mechanism of election](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#3),
which decides whichy programmers are most suitable for a particular task. The decision
is based on the previous performance of all available programmers and their
current workload in the project and in the entire [pool of projects](https://www.0crat.com/board).
On top of that, since each project and each GitHub repository we manage is
[mono-tech](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/09/05/monolithic-repositories.html),
as suggested in [M6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zljJpADEf_E),
it is even possible to randomly
distribute tasks among programmers.

Q: Why Google, Facebook, and other giants don't work with
freelancers, don't allow programmers to work remotely,
and don't use microtasking? Instead, they build campuses
to keep people together. Do you think they are stupid?

A: Yes, I do.
